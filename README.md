## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Git
- A Google Cloud / Firebase project
- Resend API key (or SendGrid alternative)
- Environment variables set up locally

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/S0URABHAGARWAL/App.git
cd App
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
SCALEON_INTERNAL_EMAIL=ops@scaleon-consulting.com
```

> **Note**: Never commit `.env.local`. Use Firebase Environment Config for production secrets.

### 3. Local Development

```bash
npm start
# or
npx http-server
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` (or port shown in terminal).

### 4. Deploy to Firebase

#### Using Firebase CLI

```bash
firebase login
firebase init
# Select Hosting + Functions

npm run build  # (if using a bundler)
firebase deploy
```

#### Using Firebase Studio (Recommended)
1. Go to [Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com).
2. Click "Import Project" → select this GitHub repo.
3. Firebase Studio will auto-detect the setup and offer guided integration.
4. Connect Gemini API, Resend API keys via the Studio UI.
5. Deploy with one click.

## 📊 Core Workflow

### Client-Facing Flow

```
1. Client opens the app (landing page)
   ↓
2. Fills in structured form:
   - Business info (industry, size, years operating)
   - Sales challenges & metrics
   - HR/team pain points
   - Operations & growth goals
   ↓
3. Submits form
   ↓
4. Frontend sends data to backend (Firebase Function)
   ↓
5. Function calls Gemini API → generates strategic report
   ↓
6. Function stores session in Firestore + triggers two emails:
   • Internal email (ScaleOn ops) with raw CSV + summary
   • Client email with polished report + CTA (schedule call, etc.)
   ↓
7. Client sees success message + can download report PDF (optional)
```

### Email Triggers

**Internal Email (ScaleOn Ops)**
- Subject: `New ScaleOn Session: [Company Name] – [Date]`
- Body: Raw session data, key metrics, AI analysis
- Attachment: CSV export of all responses
- Purpose: Log in CRM, route to relevant consultant, follow-up

**Client Email (Prospect)**
- Subject: `Your ScaleOn Strategic Report: [Company Name]`
- Body: Polished AI report, 3–5 key recommendations, next steps
- CTA: "Schedule your consultation" (Calendly link or internal booking)
- Purpose: Nurture lead, establish credibility, drive booking

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

### Environment & Secrets
- Store all API keys in Firebase Environment Config (not in code).
- Use IAM roles to restrict Cloud Function permissions.
- Enable CORS only for your domain(s).
- Validate all client inputs server-side before using Gemini API.

### Data Privacy
- Comply with GDPR / India's DPDP Act: obtain consent before storing emails.
- Anonymize or delete old session data per retention policy (e.g., 6 months).
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest in Firestore (Firebase default).

### Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting on Cloud Functions to prevent abuse.
- Cap Gemini API calls per IP / per user to control costs.
